# COVID Classification Problem

In this problem, I develop three models to classify of lung X-Rays into potential disease categories.

First Problem: COVID vs. Normal classification -> I create a neural network developed in Covid_Data_GradientCrescent/Task 1.ipynb

Second Problem: COVID vs. Normal vs. Bacterial Pneumonia vs. Viral Pneumonia -> I create two different neural networks to model these classifications.

My methodology and thought process is outlined in Final Report.pdf
