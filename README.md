# COVID Classification Problem

In this problem, I develop three models to classify of lung X-Rays into potential disease categories.

## First Problem: COVID vs. Normal classification
I create a neural network developed in Covid_Data_GradientCrescent/Task 1.ipynb

## Second Problem: COVID vs. Normal vs. Bacterial Pneumonia vs. Viral Pneumonia
I create two different neural networks to model these classifications in Covid_Data_GradientCrescent/Task 2 - Model 1.ipynb and Covid_Data_GradientCrescent/Task 2 - Model 2.ipynb

My methodology and thought process are outlined in Final Report.pdf
